# MLOps 2022 Covalent demo

Repository contains two examples of how `covalent` can be used to run your workflows:

1. `sample_workflow.ipynb`:
    - Contains a very simple workflow of adding and multiplying large numbers with a dependency graph and executing these different functions on different hardware backends.

2. `pytorch_workflow.ipynb`:
    - Contains a slightly modified version of image classification tutorial by [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) and its execution on different backends.
